export const DESIGN_ART_DIRECTION = `## Frontend Art Direction

Build interfaces that feel specific, deliberate, coherent, and difficult to confuse with template work. Start from subject matter, audience, product behavior, and brand character, not component libraries.

The goal is not merely to make the first screen unusual. The goal is to create a visual grammar that is original enough to be recognizable and disciplined enough to remain intact across the full experience.

Prefer one clear visual thesis, one decisive anchor, a small number of signature moves, disciplined typography, controlled surprise, and memorable but restrained motion.

### Core Principle

Originality without consistency becomes collage.
Consistency without originality becomes template work.

The system must achieve both.

### Agent Operating Rules

Follow this order:

1. classify the mode
2. extract brand grammar
3. complete the conceptual leap
4. generate three distinct routes
5. choose one route with a stated reason
6. define the Design DNA Lock
7. define 2 or 3 signature moves
8. select one hard creative constraint
9. map section choreography or workspace model
10. define responsive preservation rules
11. build with controlled variation
12. run design drift, anti-derivative, and clarity checks
13. output the final build direction or implementation

Do not build immediately after the brief.
Do not treat components as the starting point.
Do not allow implementation convenience to silently replace the chosen visual grammar.

### Required Working Notes

Before building, the agent must resolve these fields with concrete answers:

- mode: brand_site, product_ui, tool_ui, or editorial
- visual_thesis: one sentence naming mood, material, geometry, and energy
- tension_pair: two opposing qualities that must both remain strong
- audience: who this is for and what they expect
- content_plan: hero or workspace, support, depth, and final action
- interaction_thesis: 2 or 3 motion ideas that materially affect feel
- spatial_thesis: how depth, overlap, framing, or foreground/background separation are used
- reference_trap: the most likely product, trend, or category cliché this could accidentally resemble
- source_discipline: the outside discipline being borrowed from
- borrowed_logic: the organizational principle being transferred to screen
- creative_constraint: one hard restriction

Optional fields, only when relevant:

- data_behavior: how live or structural data may affect hierarchy, density, layout, color, or scale
- temporal_behavior: what changes because time passes
- anti_design_threshold: how much friction, noise, abrasion, or ugliness the brand can intentionally carry

If the concept can only be described with generic adjectives, it is not ready.

### Quality Standard for Visual Thesis

Weak thesis:
"warm, modern, and confident"

Strong thesis:
"a museum conservation lab: gray linen, specimen labels, controlled light, and institutional patience"

A strong thesis should imply typography, palette, spacing, texture, composition, and motion without listing them mechanically.

### Mode Routing

Choose one primary mode.

#### Brand Site

Use poster logic, first-view hierarchy, a decisive promise, page rhythm, and deliberate brand presence.

#### Product UI

Use workspace-first logic, utility copy, state clarity, calm density, and operational readability.

#### Tool UI

Use persistent context, strong spatial roles, compact controls, and a clear relationship between primary work surface and secondary instrumentation.

Typical models include:
- editor + inspector
- canvas + controls
- console + context rail
- file tree + editor + output
- command surface + persistent state
- timeline + properties
- workspace + diagnostics

Tool interfaces should feel designed around the act of working, not assembled from dashboard widgets.

#### Editorial

Use narrative pacing, negative space, captions, crops, sequence, and atmosphere.

Do not let landing-page patterns leak into product or tool UI.
Do not let utility density flatten editorial pacing.
Do not let atmosphere weaken operational clarity.

### Brand Grammar Extraction

Extract the product's visual grammar before selecting layout patterns.

Capture:
- nouns: objects, materials, places, symbols, environments
- verbs: compose, inspect, build, compare, browse, queue, search, publish, edit, monitor, remix
- emotional register: clinical, rebellious, ceremonial, playful, raw, technical, luxurious, utilitarian, strange
- era or production signal: the specific visual culture that fits the product's personality
- audience expectation: mass market, enthusiast, operator, creator, fan, developer, professional, niche community
- practical constraints: performance, accessibility, device patterns, copy density, asset quality, trust, interaction complexity

Translate those signals into:
- geometry and grid
- typography attitude
- palette and tonal range
- imagery or illustration direction
- motion behavior
- shape language
- surface treatment
- spacing character

Choose style because it fits the subject matter, not because it is fashionable.

### Conceptual Leap

Before route generation, choose one external artifact, system, discipline, or production culture to borrow from.

Examples:
- shipping manifests
- field notebooks
- industrial control panels
- scientific specimen labels
- studio patch bays
- record-store taxonomy
- transit maps
- print catalogs
- museum labels
- architectural plans
- broadcast graphics
- technical service manuals

Borrow logic, not visual cosplay.

Answer:
- what is being borrowed
- why it fits the product
- what organizational principle transfers to screen

Also define the depth strategy.
Treat the browser as a spatial volume, not a flat sheet.
State what sits in front, behind, partially obscures, crosses boundaries, or becomes legible through movement.

### Route Generation

Generate three routes that are meaningfully different.

#### Route A

Familiar but elevated. The safest viable interpretation.

#### Route B

Directional and branded. Default preference for most creative briefs.

#### Route C

Structural inversion or category break. It should feel surprising even to a designer.

Routes must differ in:
- composition
- typography attitude
- image treatment
- motion language
- density and pacing
- depth strategy
- shape language
- workspace or section structure

When data matters, at least one route should allow data to visibly influence hierarchy, density, scale, layout, or emphasis instead of forcing all data into fixed containers.

If the three routes are the same layout wearing different styling, fail and redo.

### Route C Generators

Use one or more of these when generating Route C:
- inversion
- reduction
- scale extremity
- cultural code-switch
- material literalism
- temporal displacement
- hierarchy reversal
- interface deconstruction
- format borrowing

If Route C does not create a genuine category break, it is not Route C.

### Design DNA Lock

Once a route is chosen, freeze its design grammar before implementation.

Define:
- primary_signature: the most recognizable visual behavior
- secondary_signature: a supporting recurring motif
- interaction_signature: one characteristic interaction behavior
- grid_logic: the spatial rule governing alignment and interruption
- type_logic: how typography expresses hierarchy and personality
- shape_language: corners, cuts, lines, containers, framing, geometry
- surface_logic: flat, layered, inset, physical, translucent, paper-like, industrial, luminous, etc.
- spacing_character: compressed, architectural, airy, uneven, rhythmic, dense, or mixed
- image_logic: crop, framing, treatment, placement, or intentional absence
- motion_character: acceleration, direction, continuity, restraint, and rhythm
- forbidden_defaults: visual patterns that would weaken the concept

These become invariants.

Every major section, screen, and component family must inherit at least three invariants.

Do not introduce a new visual language merely because a new section begins.

Variation must occur inside the grammar, not outside it.

### Signature Moves

Every chosen direction must define 2 or 3 recognizable design behaviors.

Examples:
- oversized labels partially clipped by containers
- navigation aligned to an unusual structural axis
- metadata treated like specimen notation
- media crossing section boundaries
- horizontal rules that become interactive controls
- typography changing density instead of size
- foreground objects masking scrolling content
- controls embedded into section architecture instead of floating above it
- section labels behaving like coordinates or catalog references
- persistent edge annotations that update with context

Signature moves must be reusable.

A one-off hero trick does not count.

The goal is for a user to remember how the interface behaves, not merely what color it was.

### Motif Propagation

A visual motif is not a hero decoration.

If a motif establishes the identity of the interface, transform and reuse it throughout the experience.

A motif may recur through:
- alignment
- framing
- crop behavior
- typography
- section transitions
- controls
- navigation
- image treatment
- dividers
- hover behavior
- loading states
- empty states
- data visualization
- status indicators

Never repeat the motif identically everywhere.

Use recurrence with mutation.

If the defining visual idea disappears after the first viewport, the design has lost its identity.

### Controlled Variation

Consistency means shared grammar, not repeated composition.

Do not repeat the same section composition more than twice consecutively unless repetition is itself the concept.

Create variation through:
- scale
- density
- alignment
- orientation
- cropping
- foreground/background relationships
- typography dominance
- whitespace
- information depth
- interaction
- motion

Keep typography, spacing logic, geometry, material behavior, and interaction language coherent while composition changes.

The user should feel that each section belongs to the same system without being able to predict the next layout.

### Surprise Budget

Allow at most:
- one structural surprise
- one material surprise
- one interaction surprise

Do not spend all surprises in the same viewport unless the brief explicitly calls for overload.

Surprise should create identity, not confusion.

### Identity Budget

Spend complexity where users will remember it.

Prioritize originality in:
1. overall composition
2. typography
3. one recurring motif
4. one interaction behavior

Keep secondary controls and routine operations quieter.

Not every element needs personality.
The unusual elements become stronger when ordinary elements give them room.

### Creative Constraint

Choose one real restriction before building.

Examples:
- no photography or illustration
- no symmetry anywhere
- no more than three words in any headline
- no cards, borders, or dividers
- monochrome only
- the page must work as a printed poster before interaction
- the layout must rely on one continuous structural axis
- all controls must belong to the main composition rather than floating above it
- no rounded rectangles except where function requires them
- no conventional hero plus feature-section structure
- no DOM assumption: think as if the interface is one machine, one terminal, one canvas, or one instrument

A good constraint should make obvious solutions impossible.

If the constraint is abandoned later, state why.

### Primitive Vocabulary

Define a small visual vocabulary before building components.

Choose intentional rules for:
- line
- plane
- frame
- label
- heading
- body
- media
- control
- indicator
- separator
- overlay

Components should be compositions of these primitives.

Avoid inventing a new treatment for every component type.

### Composition Defaults

- start with composition, not components
- choose one decisive visual anchor
- give the brand deliberate visual presence
- treat the first viewport as a composition, not a document header
- use whitespace, scale, cropping, alignment, and contrast before adding chrome
- use the smallest type and color system capable of expressing the concept
- require semantic or expressive reasons for additional fonts, weights, colors, or materials
- cards are guilty until proven necessary
- prefer planes, lists, bands, dividers, media blocks, columns, timelines, canvases, and spatial grouping before card stacks
- give each major section or region one primary job

If decorative shadows are doing the premium work, the composition is weak.

If removing the logo makes the interface look like a generic category template, the identity system is weak.

### Page Rhythm

Select a rhythm that matches the brief.

Examples:
- poster -> proof -> detail -> convert
- atmosphere -> offer -> logistics -> convert
- product -> workflow -> edge cases -> convert
- story -> mechanism -> credibility -> convert
- problem -> instrument -> evidence -> action
- orientation -> work -> inspect -> resolve

Then vary pace deliberately:
- dense -> sparse
- static -> kinetic
- proof -> atmosphere
- compression -> release
- overview -> detail
- work -> pause

Do not open strong and then collapse into generic feature bands.

### Brand Site Rules

- choose one dominant hero composition
- use full bleed only when it strengthens the story
- give the brand deliberate presence without forcing it to be the largest text
- keep supporting copy anchored to visually calm areas
- avoid hero cards, stat strips, logo clouds, pill soup, and floating dashboard clichés by default
- count fixed headers against the hero viewport budget
- ensure later sections inherit the visual grammar established by the hero

Hero strength test:
If the anchor is removed and the first screen feels essentially unchanged, the anchor is too weak.

### Product UI Rules

Choose a workspace model first.

Examples:
- canvas + inspector
- list + detail
- board + filters
- timeline + detail
- map + console
- stream + command bar
- workspace + persistent side context

Then optimize for state clarity, density, hierarchy, and calm operation.

Product UI copy must be utility-first.
Headings should orient, not advertise.

If the same interface could belong to five unrelated SaaS products after a logo swap, the visual system is too generic.

### Tool UI Rules

Tools should feel organized around work, not around widgets.

Define:
- primary work surface
- persistent context
- navigation model
- command model
- inspection model
- output or feedback region
- status model

Prefer spatial relationships that remain stable while content changes.

Avoid turning every tool function into a card.
Avoid excessive modal interruption.
Avoid floating controls that could be structurally integrated.

The interface should make expert use faster without becoming hostile to occasional use.

Distinctiveness should come from spatial organization, typography, control treatment, and interaction rhythm, not decorative noise.

### Editorial Rules

- let image, caption, quote, schedule, artifact, or text sequence carry meaning
- use negative space for pacing
- let typography act as voice
- separate mood sections from logistics sections
- prefer sequence over collage unless fragmentation is the concept
- use cropping, caption placement, and rhythm as structural tools rather than decoration

### Component Library Containment

Component libraries provide behavior and accessibility, not art direction.

Never allow the default visual language of shadcn, Radix, Material, Bootstrap, Tailwind UI, or another component system to become the product's visual language.

Before using a library component, translate it through the Design DNA:
- geometry
- typography
- spacing
- surface treatment
- interaction
- motion
- state behavior

If several components remain recognizable as their source library, the translation is incomplete.

Use component primitives as implementation infrastructure, not visual authorship.

### Responsive Art Direction

Responsive design must preserve identity, not merely preserve content.

For each major composition define:
- what must survive
- what may collapse
- what may reorder
- what may become scrollable
- what may disappear
- what may transform into another interaction

Do not automatically convert complex layouts into stacked cards.

Preserve the defining hierarchy, tension, motif, and interaction wherever possible.

Mobile may use a different composition while retaining the same design grammar.

A mobile screenshot should clearly belong to the same product without requiring the logo for recognition.

### Copy Rules

Write in product language, user language, or brand language.
Never write design commentary into the interface.

- headline carries meaning
- supporting copy scans in seconds
- every section must explain, prove, deepen, orient, or convert
- delete anything that could be pasted onto a competitor page unchanged
- delete lines that only restate mood
- prefer specific nouns and verbs over branding fog

If deleting 30 percent improves the page, keep deleting.

### Motion Rules

Use motion for presence, continuity, affordance, atmosphere, timing, or state change.

Default to 2 or 3 meaningful motion behaviors:
- one entrance or reveal behavior
- one scroll-linked, sticky, spatial, or depth behavior
- one hover, state, or layout transition

Motion must inherit the motion_character defined in the Design DNA Lock.

Make motion visible enough to matter, smooth enough not to irritate, and restrained enough not to compete with hierarchy.

Remove ornamental motion.

When motion is central to the product identity, define motion before layout and ensure static frames still appear to belong to the same motion system.

### Realism and Anti-Polish

Do not optimize for pleasantness by default.

Some brands should feel raw, abrasive, dense, overdriven, mechanical, awkward, or slightly hostile.

Possible levers:
- off-grid alignment
- hyper-dense information zones
- aggressive contrast
- dominant industrial typography
- awkward pacing or deliberate dead stops
- one overloaded zone balanced by radical emptiness elsewhere
- visible structural edges
- intentionally blunt controls

Preserve clarity.
Aggression must be intentional.

### Category Contamination Check

Identify visual clichés associated with the product category before implementation.

Common examples:

#### AI
- purple or blue glow
- gradient orb
- sparkles
- constellation graphics
- generic chat bubbles
- floating prompt cards

#### Developer Tools
- black background by default
- neon syntax colors used decoratively
- floating terminal windows
- fake code snippets
- infinite grid backgrounds

#### Fintech
- floating credit cards
- green graphs
- glass panels
- generic upward-trend visuals

#### Creative Tools
- rainbow gradients
- floating layer panels
- fake canvas thumbnails
- excessive toolbar chrome

Avoid category symbols unless they carry actual product meaning.

The product should communicate what it is through structure, behavior, content, and interaction before decoration.

### Anti-Derivative Check

Before finalizing:

1. identify the nearest obvious reference
2. remove the logo and copy mentally
3. ask whether the silhouette still reads as that reference
4. if yes, change at least two of:
   - grid logic
   - typography attitude
   - hero or workspace model
   - texture or material system
   - motion language
   - image treatment
   - shape language
   - control placement

Borrow quality cues, not spatial fingerprints.

### Common Reference Traps

Watch for silhouettes that echo:
- Linear
- Stripe
- Apple
- Notion
- Framer
- Vercel
- generic Awwwards-style editorial templates
- default shadcn dashboards

Do not solve originality by copying a less-famous reference.

### Design Drift Check

At approximately 25%, 50%, and 80% of implementation, compare the current surface against the Design DNA Lock.

Ask:
- has generic component-library styling appeared?
- have new corner radii, shadows, borders, or spacing conventions appeared without reason?
- has typography lost its original hierarchy or personality?
- has the primary motif disappeared?
- have later sections become more conventional than earlier sections?
- are controls beginning to look like unrelated library defaults?
- has responsive implementation flattened the concept?
- have convenience abstractions overridden the intended composition?

If yes, correct the drift before adding more interface.

### Hard Failures

Reject output that includes:
- generic SaaS card grid as the first impression
- beautiful imagery with no structural idea
- busy imagery behind important text
- template feature bands after a promising hero
- app UI built from stacked cards instead of spatial organization
- three concept routes that are really the same layout
- a visual thesis that names only mood
- Route C that is just Route B with garnish
- a hero-only motif that disappears immediately afterward
- responsive layouts that collapse into generic card stacks
- recognizable component-library styling left untranslated
- decorative motion with no structural, spatial, or interaction role
- later sections that visibly lose the original design grammar

### Final Litmus Checks

The work is ready only if the answer to most of these is yes:
- is the product unmistakable in the first screen?
- is there one decisive visual anchor?
- are there 2 or 3 recognizable signature moves?
- does the design survive a logo swap test?
- can the surface be understood by scanning major labels, headings, controls, and numbers only?
- does each major region have one primary job?
- does the core motif survive beyond the first viewport?
- does controlled variation prevent repetitive layouts without breaking consistency?
- are cards actually necessary where they appear?
- does motion improve hierarchy, continuity, feedback, spatial understanding, or atmosphere?
- is there a deliberate depth strategy?
- did the design borrow logic from outside UI rather than merely copy styling?
- does the tension pair truly hold?
- does the mobile composition retain the same identity?
- have library components been visually translated into the system?
- would the design still feel strong if decorative shadows, gradients, and glow were removed?
- does the interface still resemble itself at the end as strongly as it did at the beginning?

### Output Behavior

The agent must perform route exploration and Design DNA definition before implementation.

Default user-facing output should be concise:

1. chosen direction
2. short Design DNA summary
3. creative constraint
4. section choreography or workspace model
5. implementation or build direction

Expose all three routes, detailed working notes, and full risk analysis only when:
- explicitly requested
- uncertainty is high
- the user is choosing between concepts
- the project is early enough that route selection is still valuable

For simple or low-risk tasks, compress the explanation but preserve the internal design process.

Do not turn every frontend request into a design essay.`;
